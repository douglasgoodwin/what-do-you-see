# what do you see?
geenrate imagery by one of three approaches.

1. generate sequences synthetic clouds and submit them to an AI that determines if the images are SFW. Collect the images that will not pass for safe	
2. start a database of cloud images. search through frames of pornography for areas that may be classified as cloud. Replace the source images with clouds. 
3. find the "skies" in databases of pornography. use a computer to determine if the image contains sky. 
4. is this working?

## things to try
gather images of clouds, add to local deepdream database. 

all the images in the frame are made synthetically or generatively. for example, you might make the decor out of images of the bestselling armchairs. Or the people. Like a synthetic komar and melamid. But it's also how House of Cards was structured. People like Kevin Spacey, political intrigue, murder mysteries. 

destory the personality / diversity of local coffeeshops. West Elm and AirBnB culture. Everything will be comfortable and look familiar. 

shadows interacting with composited environments where the images are made from synethesis. 

But start with just the clouds. Let them develop into imagery that's NSFW. 

everything is produced by morphing and averaging. 

AI creating narratives.

look at this video and document his approach. How does he "tune" his database?

> It's called fine tuning. And what it does is, you can take an already trained network, for example, the Google Net. And all you have to do is to cut off the bottom layer. And then you can retrain it with new material. And what happens is, all the top layers are pretty much the same, no matter what you train it with, because they look for abstract elements like edges, curvature, or things like that. So that doesn't need to be retrained. So doing that, you can take a trained network. You feed in new images. Instead of taking four weeks, you can train a network overnight. And the way I do it-- well, I tried it with I called it MNIST with a twist.

Mario is doing other work with morphing and averaging.

## questions
1. would greyscale images provide more NSFWness?
2. where would we find a useful cloud library? See below.
3. what about [pareidolia](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22686500)?
